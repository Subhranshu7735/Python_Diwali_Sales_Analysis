1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
2. Handled missing values, data types, and inconsistencies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
4. Visualized sales trends, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns.
5. Identified top-selling products, customer segments, and peak sales periods.

**Statistical Analysis:**

1. Used descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
2. Analyzed relationships between different variables using correlation and pivot tables.

**Visualizations:**
Created bar plots, line charts, heatmaps, and box plots to illustrate key findings.

**Tools and Libraries:**
1. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: Numerical operations.
3. Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
4. Matplotlib: Plotting and graphing.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Diwali_Sales_Project.ipynb) to view the analysis.
